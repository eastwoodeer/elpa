;;; Commentary:

;; Disk-data APIs over pi session JSONL files: reading entries, building
;; the raw nested session tree, projecting that tree to the flat display
;; dialect the tree browser consumes, formatting tool-call previews,
;; computing tree-navigation targets and byte-preserving rewritten line
;; orders (non-chain lines stay in physical order; selected chains use
;; logical parent order), and discovering session files on disk (sessions
;; root, munged per-cwd directories, canonical shared metadata scans).
;; This ports pi's session-manager getTree (plus label folding), the RPC tree
;; projection, navigateTree's
;; leaf rule, core format-tool-call, and config/session-dir path munging.
;; Depends only on core; does not manage UI/session state or processes.
;; Reading uses temporary buffers.  Resumable scans expose caller-owned
;; parser state whose decoded scratch buffer must be explicitly closed.
;;
;; Normalization conventions (JSON in, plists out):
;;
;; - JSON null decodes to the :null keyword (`json-parse-string') and is
;;   treated exactly like an absent value: nullable fields go through
;;   `pilish--jsonl-entry-parent-id' or core's
;;   `pilish--normalize-string-or-null', and this module never
;;   emits :null itself.  Empty strings in nullable metadata likewise
;;   normalize as absent.
;; - JSON arrays are vectors, never lists.
;; - Numbers pass through with their zero-ness intact: presence checks
;;   use `numberp' (never truthiness), so an offset of 0 or a limit of 0
;;   still counts as present.  For read's offset and limit the reference
;;   compares against undefined rather than truthiness, so JSON null
;;   counts as present there too and coerces like JS null
;;   (`pilish--jsonl-arg-number').
;; - Key orders are canonical.  Raw nodes are (:entry :children :label
;;   :labelTimestamp) with the label pair only when a label is set.
;;   Projected nodes start with the base (:id :parentId :timestamp
;;   :label :children) followed by type-specific payload keys;
;;   :parentId and assistant :stopReason are always present (possibly
;;   nil), every other optional key only when non-nil.  Children are
;;   always vectors.
;;
;; Deliberate deviations from the TypeScript reference, documented
;; rather than fixed:
;;
;; - Malformed or blank JSONL lines are skipped silently while reading a
;;   session file.
;; - Children sort by timestamp STRING comparison while the reference
;;   parses dates numerically; equivalent for the uniform UTC ISO-8601
;;   stamps pi writes, and both keep file order on ties.
;; - Session files older than version 3 are read as-is, without pi's
;;   on-load migrations: hookMessage roles project as unknown and
;;   version 1 files (no ids or parent ids) build as flat root lists.
;; - Null or malformed message payloads (JSON null :message, null
;;   content, null content blocks) degrade to empty previews instead
;;   of throwing like the reference would; session files are parsed
;;   without validation and old or hand-edited files can carry them.
;; - Historical Pi versions could persist duplicated headers and entries
;;   while forking.  Repeated entries with the same nonempty id and equal
;;   content canonicalize to one occurrence.  Differing repeats use Pi's
;;   deterministic later-wins entry while carrying an explicit ambiguity
;;   diagnostic.  Ambiguous ids are unaddressable/unmarked, and ancestry
;;   that would cross one fails closed; unrelated history remains useful.
;;   Nil/empty legacy ids stay visible but unaddressable and do not
;;   participate in duplicate detection.
;; - `pilish--jsonl-shorten-path' replaces the HOME (or
;;   USERPROFILE) prefix blindly: /home/tes also matches /home/tester/x.
;;   Faithful port of the upstream quirk.
;; - The reference truncates strings by UTF-16 code units; Elisp
;;   truncates by characters, so previews of astral-plane text can
;;   differ in length.  Accepted; session text is not surrogate-paired
;;   in practice.
;; - `pilish-jsonl-read-session-info' reports :modified from
;;   the file mtime instead of the newest message timestamp (one stat
;;   versus a per-line compare).  Append-only files agree, and the
;;   Navigation rewrites arguably make mtime more correct.
;; - `pilish-jsonl-navigation-target's :current-p describes whether its
;;   COMPUTED target position is already current, but only when both
;;   positions resolve positively.  This includes the useful historical-
;;   user re-edit case where the prompt's parent is current.
;;   `pilish-jsonl-current-projected-id' separately preserves pi's
;;   selected-entry identity check: a current user prompt is a no-op
;;   before the user-message rewind rule, and trailing projection-away
;;   bookkeeping resolves back to that prompt.
;;
;; pi 0.86+ (still format version 3) writes additional record kinds —
;; usage and context_edit — and a leading system-role message.
;; Pilish tolerates them by design: usage and context_edit are
;; projection-filtered like the other bookkeeping kinds, and the
;; system message projects (parent chains resolve onto it) while the
;; tree browsers hide it under their default filters.
;;
;; All tree traversals are iterative (explicit stacks, reversed
;; pre-order bottom-up builds); real session trees reach thousands of
;; entries deep.  The single recursion is
;; `pilish--jsonl-encode-args', which normalizes nested JSON
;; tool arguments (two or three levels by construction, never session
;; depth).

its first nonblank line, or cannot be read at all.  Key parity with
the session browser is the contract.

This is the canonical shared session metadata scanner.  The scan is
regex-first: lines route by their top-level type prefix and only headers,
session_info lines, and the first few message lines are full-parsed.
:messageCount counts message lines by regex alone
\(toolResult included).  :firstMessage full-parses at most 5 message
lines while unset: a user message with extractable text wins,
otherwise the first parsed message of any role is the fallback.
:name replays session_info lines in file order with latest-wins
trimming.  label and custom entries are ignored.  :created is the
header timestamp; :modified is the file mtime as a second-resolution
UTC ISO string (see the deviation note in the Commentary).

Non-nil SEARCH-TEXT additionally parses every type-first message line,
collecting user/assistant string content and text blocks across all disk
branches, not thinking, tools, images or summaries.  :searchText is one
prepared corpus: name, firstMessage, then these texts, separated by spaces.
The legacy firstMessage prefix is preserved even for an any-role fallback.
Nil SEARCH-TEXT retains the cheap metadata-only parsing budget and keys."

  (:leaf-id ID-OR-NIL :prefill TEXT? :current-p BOOL):

  - :leaf-id is the entry the session file must END on after the
    navigate rewrite — pi's navigateTree leaf rule: a user message or a
    custom_message rewinds to its normalized parent id so the message can
    be re-sent or re-edited (nil when the parent does not exist — the root
    user message has nothing to rewind to); every other entry type targets
    itself.
  - :prefill, present only for those rewind targets with extractable
    text, is the contentText port of the entry's content: strings pass
    through, block content joins text blocks with the EMPTY separator,
    unbounded (the preview dialect's space join and 200-char cap do not
    apply); image-only or empty content omits the key entirely.
  - :current-p reports that the file already sits on the computed
    leaf position only when the resolved target position and resolved
    raw leaf (`pilish--jsonl-resolve-visible' on both sides) are BOTH
    non-nil and equal.  An ambiguous, unknown, or all-filtered nil
    resolution is not evidence of equality.  Thus a literal self-target
    leaf remains pi's raw-id no-op, a trailing bookkeeping leaf folds up
    onto the entry it sits on, and a rewind target is current when its
    parent is the positively resolved current position.  This is
    deliberately different from
    selected-entry identity: callers implementing pi's initial no-op
    must first compare TARGET-ID with
    `pilish-jsonl-current-projected-id', so a current user entry is not
    mistaken for a request to re-edit it.

Equal duplicate entries canonicalize to one.  A differing duplicate id
and any target whose required ancestor chain crosses it fail closed;
unrelated unique branches remain available through the deterministic
later-wins canonical index."

The result is a vector of unibyte raw line strings WITHOUT their LF
delimiters — the caller joins them with LF and adds the final one — or
nil when PATH is unreadable, empty, or its first nonblank line is
not the session header (`pilish--jsonl-parse-session-header's
rule), or LEAF-ID is nil or names no entry.  Like pi's reader,
whitespace-only leading lines are trimmed noise before the header,
and a UTF-8 BOM prefixing the header line is tolerated for that check
alone: the check decodes a copy with the three bytes stripped while
the returned raw lines stay verbatim.
Every other byte is retained: in particular, the CR of
a CRLF delimiter remains the line's last byte, so joining with LF
reproduces CRLF exactly.  The header line and any blank lines before
it stay at the front, byte-for-byte; the lines after the header are
partitioned into the non-chain lines (first, byte-for-byte
in original relative order), followed by the canonical ancestor-chain
lines in logical parent order from root/orphan-root through LEAF-ID.  Thus
LEAF-ID is the file's last line and the next append lands on it.  The
chain walks parent ids from LEAF-ID and stops at nil, self, unknown, or
cyclic parents (an unknown parent is a root, matching
`pilish-jsonl-build-tree's roots rule); malformed and blank
lines after the header are non-chain bytes preserved verbatim in their
original relative positions.  Equal duplicate entries are tolerated and
their last line is canonical.  Differing duplicate ids use that same
later-wins index for unrelated chains, but a requested chain touching an
ambiguous id fails closed.  Earlier duplicate and nil/legacy physical
