;;; Commentary:

;; Session and tree browsing for Pilish.
;;
;; Provides two read-only, refreshable, keyboard-driven buffers:
;;   - Session Browser: find, filter, switch, rename, and delete sessions
;;   - Tree Browser: continue from a selected turn and label nodes (like /tree)
;;
;; The two browsers display different graphs.  The tree browser moves
;; the active path inside ONE session file, while the session browser's
;; Threaded view shows fork families: SEPARATE session files whose
;; headers point back at a parent (the /fork and /clone commands).
;;
;; Session data comes from time-sliced scans of JSONL files on disk,
;; and conversation trees are projected from the linked chat's JSONL
;; session file.  Browsing does not need a live pi process, but the tree
;; shows the last persisted turn, so it can lag an in-flight turn;
;; refresh manually with `g'.  Tree labels are appended out-of-band and
;; fold back into every disk read.
;;
;; Session switching uses menu.el's guarded resume flow.  Renaming the
;; linked current session asks pi to append session_info; renaming any
;; other session appends session_info out-of-band.  Tree navigation
;; guards the linked session, process, and loaded file; computes the
;; target from fresh JSONL data; atomically rewrites an ordinary local
;; session file so the target's ancestor chain ends it (write-temp +
;; rename — the rename is the only step that touches the file); resumes
;; the rewritten file through menu; prefills the input buffer with the
;; target's re-edit text; and dismisses the browser window once the
;; transition settles.  Navigation does not auto-reopen the browser
;; (refresh with `g'); rewinding before the first message points at the
;; chat's fork command instead.

separators beyond one collapse (///a is /a).  Windows drive
spellings — C:/x, C:\\x, and the drive root C:/ — parse as `windows'
with the upcased drive as the first component, so slash and
backslash spellings of one directory share an identity and the drive
disambiguates colliding basenames; a bare C: is drive-relative, not
a project directory, and is rejected.  A UNC spelling — exactly two
leading separators, forward or back, followed by nonempty server and
share components — parses as `unc' with those components as anchors,
never aliasing a rooted POSIX path that merely has the same
components.  Repeated separators after the introducer collapse, so

fewer than two nonempty anchors and dot or dot-dot anchors reject.

  "Return a hash table mapping session key to its All-projects token.
Tokens are built from every project in ITEMS — the full loaded set,
not the filtered rows — so a query never silently relabels the rows
it leaves behind.  Rows whose cwd was rejected map to the
placeholder instead; the field is always reserved.  When ELLIPSIS is
non-nil, it marks any generated-tail truncation; ordinary rows retain
their established compact field when it is nil.

Allocation is deterministic and exact.  Identities are deduplicated
and sorted once, each grows the shortest readable label that
distinguishes it (see `pilish--session-project-label'), and all
candidates are grouped by their NFKC-normalized exact padded display
field (see `pilish--session-project-display-key').  A group yields a
natural token only when it holds exactly one candidate whose label
fits the token width, is not blank-looking or zero-width-bearing,
and spells neither the reserved `#' prefix nor the placeholder's own
field.  Thus trailing-space, canonical-Unicode, and compatibility-Unicode
equivalents move together to the generated class; blank/filler and
zero-width-bearing identities move there even alone; and a project
literally named `?' cannot impersonate
the placeholder.  Every other identity — over width, reserved,
display-unsafe, or field-colliding, with its whole group — gets a
generated token `#ORD tail': fixed-width
base-36 ordinals over the sorted class (width scaled to the class
size by `pilish--session-ordinal-width'), plus the label's basename
truncated to the remaining display columns (marked by ELLIPSIS when
non-nil).  Ordinals lead, so generated
fields are pairwise unique and never collide with naturals; the
shape holds for any practical archive (15 ordinal columns cover
36^15 - 1 positive ordinals)."

FILTER-MODE controls browser filtering, and SEARCH-TOKENS are the

DEPTH is ancestry depth in the final displayed topology.  It deliberately
is not inferred from PREFIX: a one-child chain has no connector glyphs but
still has parent/child structure.  When PUBLISHED-VALUES is a hash table,
record every addressable, unambiguous, universally displayable string id,
including ids hidden by the current filter or search.  The browser uses that
set to prune fold state only when nodes leave the published tree, not when
they temporarily leave the display.

Filtering and search happen before topology is derived.  Hidden nodes'

actions resolve the raw retained spelling through
`pilish--session-browser-path-at-point'.
PREFIX is the Threaded-view connector — the empty string for a family
root, gutters and a branch for descendants.  A nil PREFIX renders a
flat row, where a forked session gets a \"fork:\" prefix instead.
In All projects scope the row leads with its bounded project token
looked up in FIELDS by SESSION's key (see
`pilish--session-project-fields' — the placeholder token keeps the
field reserved when the recorded cwd was rejected), padded to the
fixed token width, followed by a two-column live field, and only
then the unbounded connector and title — so identity and live
status survive any connector depth, common prefix, or long title in
a narrow window.  This-project rows keep the compact connector-first
shape because the scope already fixes the project.  When SESSION's
key is a key of LIVE-PATHS (see
`pilish--browse-live-session-paths' — only Pilish processes in this
Emacs, never other Emacs instances or system-wide pi processes),
prepend a live-session marker.

Keys are canonical identities (`pilish--canonical-session-path'):

their complete TRAMP route, so a final-hop-only spelling of a
multi-hop session is not cross-marked.  Rows compare their stored
`:canonicalPath' through `pilish--session-item-key'.  The table
reflects only the frontend's own process state — sessions opened in
other Emacs instances or outside Pilish are not marked — and is
empty with no live process, so disk browsing stays fully usable

  "Delete the session at point after contextual confirmation.
The prompt leads with whether Emacs will move the file to trash or
permanently delete it, then identifies the display-bounded human
session name and project and reports known direct child forks from the
full loaded snapshot.  Children are not cascade-deleted; they appear
as roots if the parent no longer appears elsewhere in the archive,
while deeper descendants retain their own parents.  Live/child matching
uses canonical identity, but `delete-file' receives the selected raw
pathname, preserving symlink and file-handler semantics.

Refuse a session used by a live Pilish process before prompting and
check that identity again after confirmation.  Also recompute the
selected pathname's canonical identity and reject an observed change,
such as a symlink retargeted while the prompt was active.  This is a
best-effort observation, not locking: it cannot detect a same-path
replacement that preserves the canonical spelling, and an independent
writer can still change the path between this check and `delete-file'.
Live detection
covers only Pilish processes in this Emacs, not another Emacs or a
system-wide process.  Cancellation and a signaled `delete-file' leave
the browser snapshot unrefreshed; success refreshes through the existing

`pilish--browse-session-file-state' so :parentId is the id of
the current last parseable line (never the browser's cached leaf),
which keeps the entry from orphaning the context on the next load, and
the fresh id is checked against every id already in the file (pi's
loader cannot tolerate duplicates — see
`pilish--browse-fresh-entry-id').  When the file does not end
in a newline a separator is inserted first — bytes are never glued
onto a partial line.  PAYLOAD's pairs are encoded verbatim after the
shared :type/:id/:parentId/:timestamp head, so an omitted key stays
omitted (clearing a label relies on that: the load-time fold treats an
absent :label as cleared).

The file is NEVER created: pi's _persist appends per-entry once the
file exists, and its full-rewrite path is an exclusive create ('wx')
that only runs when the file never existed — creating it here would
crash pi's next flush with EEXIST.  So this helper only ever appends
to an existing readable file.  Races: a concurrent pi append between
the read and the write turns our line into a benign sibling (name
resolution is file-order latest-wins and projection filters these
bookkeeping entries), and stale-parent orphans are impossible by

The section at point is captured as a `magit-section-ident' before the
erase; after rendering, point moves to that section's start (plus the
captured intra-section column offset).  Falls back to `point-min' when
the section no longer exists (e.g. filtered away or state change).

FALLBACK, when non-nil, is a `(IDENT . OFFSET)' anchor (from
`pilish--browse-capture-point-anchor') captured before an
intermediate render destroyed the sections point sat on — the fetch
cycle renders a loading state before the final render.  It is used
only when the point-local capture yields no anchor, so a plain
rerender (no FALLBACK) behaves exactly as before.

MISSING-SECTION-FN, when non-nil, is called after rendering with the
chosen anchor when its exact section is absent (and also when there
was no anchor).  It may return another Magit section to select.  This
keeps tree-specific ancestor/active-path policy inside the tree
browser while retaining this function as the one point-restoration
mechanism for both browsers.

When IGNORE-CURRENT-ANCHOR is non-nil, do not capture the section under
point before erasing; only FALLBACK may provide an anchor.  The tree
browser uses this when another session file takes ownership of a reused
buffer, so a shared node id from the old file cannot survive its loading
render and override fresh active-leaf orientation.

After the restore, every live window displaying BUF is synced to the
restored position: `erase-buffer' clamps all displaying windows to
bob and `goto-char' moves only the buffer's own point, so without
`set-window-point' a pane whose window is not selected keeps showing
point-at-top (same idiom as `pilish--with-scroll-preservation'
in ui.el).  The sync covers exact, resolved, and point-min restore

chunked (see `pilish--browse-scan-session-files') and shows a loading

  "Load PATH's conversation tree, then call CALLBACK with (TREE LEAF-ID MESSAGE).
TREE is a vector of projected root nodes in the browse node dialect,
LEAF-ID the projected leaf entry id, and MESSAGE an error string or
nil on success — the same shape as the session side's (ITEMS ERROR)
callback.  The third MESSAGE argument lets callers render precise
error states instead of a generic \"no tree\".  On a successful
canonicalization with differing duplicate ids, CALLBACK receives a
fourth DIAGNOSTIC string; callbacks on ordinary/error paths retain the
three-argument contract.

The tree comes from the linked chat's session file on DISK —
`pilish-jsonl-project-session-file' — never an RPC get_tree.
Labels appended out-of-band fold back on every disk read, navigation
rewrites this same file, and no process is needed — the state
:session-file key persists after process death.  The tree shows
the last PERSISTED turn, so it lags an in-flight turn; refresh
manually with \\[pilish-browse-refresh].

PATH defaults to the linked chat's current session file for direct
seam callers.  The browser fetch passes the path and GENERATION it
claimed before its loading paint, so render-time reentrancy cannot
reverse request order or retarget the read away from the file that
owns that fetch's orientation and anchors.  Direct seam callers omit
GENERATION and claim a new one here, mirroring
`pilish--browse-load-sessions'.

A missing chat link reports the link error and a link with no session
file yet — or one naming a path that does not exist — reports the
not-yet error, both synchronously while the request still owns its
generation.  Otherwise the read itself is deferred through
`(run-at-time 0 ...)' so the caller's forced redisplay can paint the
loading state first (see `pilish--tree-browser-fetch-and-render':
Emacs runs due 0-timers before redisplaying, so without the forced
paint a single timer hop starves the loading render entirely); then
it runs as one blocking read (a 53 MB worst-case session reads in
~0.6 s, typical files in tens of milliseconds; chunking would
complicate the pure jsonl reader for no UI gain).

File handlers can reenter Emacs during `file-exists-p' or the disk
projection.  Ownership is therefore checked immediately after each
callback-capable boundary and again by the browser callback before
publication.  Superseded work is dropped without calling CALLBACK.
The read remains wrapped in `condition-case': a nil or garbage read
reports MESSAGE \"Session file is unreadable or not a pi session file:
PATH\" instead of signaling.  A `quit' during the blocking read reports
\"Session file read was interrupted: PATH\" — `quit' is not an `error',
so without its own handler the
callback would never run and the browser would sit on its loading
state forever."

APPROVED-DRAFT is an ephemeral text/image snapshot accepted before a
recursive revalidation pass.  NAVIGATION-OWNER is captured before the
first prompt and normally starts nil.
Guard → rewrite → switch → reload → prefill, mirroring pi's
navigateTree without a navigate RPC.  An interactive draft answer is
bound to the browser buffer, linked chat buffer, and session file
captured before the prompt.  Revalidation aborts if any owner changed
or died instead of resolving NODE-ID in a newly current tree:

 1. a live linked chat buffer, else `user-error' \"No pi session to
    continue from selected turn\";
 2. the loaded-file guard (as `pilish--browse-set-label'):
    a fresh session-file resolution that is nil messages \"Pi: Cannot
    continue from selected turn: no session file\", one that disagrees with
    `pilish--tree-browser-loaded-file' messages \"Pi: Session
    changed since the tree was loaded — refresh with g\" (the rewrite
    would have to pick one of two files);
 3. a live pi process, else `user-error' \"Pi process is not running\";
 4. no in-flight session transition (the first half of
    `pilish--browse-transition-refused-p') —
    `--session-transition-ready-p' cannot see one (status stays idle
    during the latch), and a second RET during a switch would race it;
 5. `pilish--session-transition-ready-p' with the action
    \"continue from selected turn\" (the second half; reports its own refusal);
 6. a FRESH `pilish-jsonl-read-file' — the browser's cached
    tree can lag the file — else the unreadable message;
 7. a versioned header: version 1 files (no ids) refuse with the
    migrate hint;
 8. `pilish-jsonl-navigation-target': unknown node ids refuse with
    the refresh hint;
 9. selected identity against `pilish-jsonl-current-projected-id': the
    actual current projected entry just messages \"Pi: Already at
    current position\".  This check precedes the user-message rewind
    rule, so a current root/user prompt — including one followed by
    projected-away bookkeeping — performs no write, switch, prefill,
    settle wait, or draft replacement;
10. a nil :leaf-id on a HISTORICAL root user message refuses with the
    fork hint — the chat's fork command does that job;
11. navigation target :current-p handles the distinct historical-user
    re-edit case where its parent and the current leaf positively resolve
    to the same position (two unresolved nils never qualify): a nonempty
    text/image draft first gets a targeted replacement prompt;
    acceptance recursively re-runs every guard and disk/target lookup,
    then restores :prefill, messages success, and schedules settle, but
    performs no write or switch.  A target without :prefill only reports
    that it is already at the current position and cannot prompt because
    it replaces no draft;
12. the resume cwd pre-flight (`--session-file-cwd-or-error') runs
    BEFORE any write so its `user-error's surface before the file
    changes;
13. `pilish-jsonl-navigation-lines' resolves the rewrite bytes; an
    unreadable result stops without prompting or replacing the draft;
14. when the rewrite path would replace a nonempty text/image draft,
    its targeted confirmation runs before the file rewrite or resume;
    acceptance recursively re-runs steps 1–13, so bytes and guards
    observed before the interactive prompt are never committed;
15. the local atomic rewrite (`--browse-rewrite-session-file') — the
    closing rename is the ONLY call that touches the session file;
    pre-commit local failure messages and stops byte-identically;
16. `pilish--resume-selected-session' (PROC CHAT-BUF PATH) —
    a same-path switch is legal, so the switch rides the normal
    choreography including the transition latch and history reload;
17. the input prefill runs immediately after the resume RPC is
    scheduled (the latch blocks sending until the switch settles),
    against the input buffer captured from the chat BEFORE the RPC.
    If yielding rewrite/resume work exposed a newer nonempty draft,
    preserve it and skip the prefill;
18. \"Pi: Continued from selected turn: PREVIEW\" from the cached tree
    (`--tree-find-node', `--tree-node-preview', truncated to 60;
    \"Pi: Continued from selected turn\" without a preview), then
    `pilish--browse-quit-when-settled';
19. no auto-reopen of the browser — refresh with `g'.

On ordinary local files this guard/read/rewrite path is synchronous
apart from the optional draft confirmation; an accepted answer starts a
fresh guarded pass.  The ready guard idles the linked pi process but
cannot exclude another pi instance or external writer; a writer between
the final authoritative line read and rename can lose its change.  TRAMP
file handlers may yield, and their rename need not be atomic.  These
residual risks are accepted here rather than inventing cross-module
writer coordination."

LINES is the `pilish-jsonl-navigation-lines' vector; the

the closing `rename-file': bytes land without coding or end-of-line
conversion in a sibling temp file (`.pi-nav-…' in PATH's directory)
that carries PATH's modes best-effort, then replace PATH.  On ordinary
local files the sibling is on the same filesystem and rename is the
atomic commit; pi holds no persistent descriptor on session files, so
its next append/read opens the replacement.  On TRAMP a handler may
degrade rename to copy+delete: replacement can be visible in pieces
and a remote failure cannot promise a byte-identical original.  This
is accepted because in-place writing is strictly worse.

The rewrite reorders complete raw lines only.  It always adds one final
LF; CR bytes returned for CRLF lines remain in place, so an all-CRLF
file with its final delimiter stays all-CRLF.  A file missing its
trailing newline gains LF (or CRLF when its final raw line ends in CR).
The ready guard only idles the linked pi process: an independent
append/change between the
fresh line read and local rename can still be lost.  `unwind-protect'
removes the temp on an error or quit before commit.  Thus on ordinary
local files pre-commit failures leave PATH byte-identical and no temp
behind; errors report \"Pi: Could not continue from selected turn: …\"

  "Fetch tree and re-render the tree browser.
The tree is read from the linked chat's session file on disk, so no
live pi process is required.  The callback reports (TREE LEAF-ID
MESSAGE): a non-nil MESSAGE renders as an error state with a zero
visible count.  On success, `pilish--tree-browser-loaded-file'
records the file resolved before the deferred read, so a chat session
switch mid-read leaves the label and continuation guards comparing
against the tree actually displayed; it is nil on error states.

The point anchor AND its old selected-node lineage are captured before
the loading render and before the callback replaces the tree.  A
missing selected node can therefore resolve to its nearest surviving
OLD ancestor instead of inventing ancestry from the replacement tree.
A refresh issued while another fetch is loading reuses both in-flight
values.

`pilish--tree-browser-state-file' owns orientation and anchors.  A
fetch for another file resets them and suppresses capture from the old
sections during the loading render; shared ids across session files
therefore cannot override fresh active-leaf orientation.  A same-file
refresh retains the ordinary point-preservation behavior.

The loading state is painted EXPLICITLY: the deferred read is a
single `(run-at-time 0 ...)' hop, and Emacs runs due 0-timers before
redisplaying, so without the forced `redisplay' here the loading
render would never become visible (the chunked session scan yields
to redisplay between its slices; one timer hop never does)."

FALLBACK is a pre-fetch `(IDENT . OFFSET)' anchor and
FALLBACK-LINEAGE is its ancestry captured from the old tree.  A fresh
tree snapshot instead orients to its active projected leaf (or nearest
visible ancestor).  Subsequent renders preserve the selected section;
if it disappears, the resolver tries the captured old lineage before
the new active path and deterministic first-row fallback.

When IGNORE-CURRENT-ANCHOR is non-nil, neither this function nor the
generic renderer captures the section currently under point.  A new
session-file owner uses that mode for its loading render.  GENERATION
and OWNER, when supplied by a completed load, fence actual Magit
insertion and every post-render orientation/point write.  Every other
render snapshots the current generation and owner, so loading,
filtering, and search renders have the same protection.

Only one render transaction runs per buffer.  Reentrant rerenders and
completed loads retain only their newest request.  On unwind, a current
completed load wins; otherwise the newest ordinary rerender repaints.
An obsolete transaction throws to its local boundary first, ensuring a
